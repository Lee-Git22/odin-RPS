# odin-RPS
A rock paper scissors project outlined by the odin project, written in javascript


Reflection: 
Pretty straightforward and easy project. I've decided to write additional logic for getPlayerChoice that prompts player to reselect if they give an invalid input. I've also added a prompt that lets the player decide how many rounds they wish to play. 
I also wonder if there are more efficient ways to implement playRound that does not require so many hard coded case comparisons.
