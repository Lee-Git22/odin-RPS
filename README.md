# odin-RPS
A rock paper scissors project outlined by the odin project, written in javascript


Reflection part1 - console RPS: 
Pretty straightforward and easy project. I've decided to write additional logic for getPlayerChoice that prompts player to reselect if they give an invalid input. I've also added a prompt that lets the player decide how many rounds they wish to play. 
I also wonder if there are more efficient ways to implement playRound that does not require so many hard coded case comparisons. 

Reflection part2 - interactive RPS:
Just finished making a minimal interactive RPS using buttons and generating the right messages for each round. The project looks very bare bones but it works, mostly because the html elements are generated by javascript and I wanted to keep the js script file clean so I applied minimal styling. In the future I will definitely revisit the project and add styling, and graphics to the site by adding a separate CSS sheet.
